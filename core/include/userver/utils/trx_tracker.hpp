/// @brief Tracking for heavy operations while having active transactions.
///
/// Some operations, like http requests, are heavy and can take
/// too long during an incident. If they are called during an active
/// database transaction, connection will be held for longer and
/// connection pool will be exhausted. Transaction tracker prevents this
/// by holding counter of active transactions in TaskLocalVariable
/// and checking for active transactions in heavy operaions.
///
/// ## Example usage:
