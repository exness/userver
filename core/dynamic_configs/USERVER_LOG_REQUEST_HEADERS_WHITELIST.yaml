    If the @ref USERVER_LOG_REQUEST_HEADERS option is enabled,
    you can control which HTTP headers are logged, including their values.
    Header is suitable if it exactly matches one of the values in the whitelist.
    Any headers that are not on the whitelist will have their values replaced with *** in the logs.
    E.g. ["User-Agent", "Accept-Encoding"].
