# userver proto structs generator

The generator is currently highly experimental, cmake integration is non-existent.

To get proper syntax highlighting in an IDE, add `userver/scripts` directory to your Python Path. For example, in `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/scripts"
    ],
    "python.languageServer": "Pylance"
}
```
